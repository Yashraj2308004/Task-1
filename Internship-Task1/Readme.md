# 🔍 Local Network Scanning Task (Internship)

This folder contains screenshots of local network scanning and enumeration task performed by me as part of my cybersecurity internship.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- `ifconfig` – From this I got my local ip and subnet also for further scanning.
- `nmap` – Using this I performed basic scanning of whole subnet and tried running some scripts also on the open ports which I found.
- `zenmap` – Scanned network in my windows machine with GUI.
- `bettercap` – performed network scanning and host discovery and also tried arp spoofing which I found while I was searching for more tools for network scanning.
- `ettercap` – With this also I performed network scanning and tried sniffing passwords and usernam on http website but didn't worked on https websites.
- `enum4linux` – Somewhere in one article I got to know aboout this so I performed smb enumaration with this on of my device where I found smb port open.
